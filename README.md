Marvin is a CLI tool designed to help Kubernetes cluster administrators 
ensure the security and reliability of their environments. 

Using a comprehensive set of [CEL (Common Expression Language)](https://github.com/google/cel-spec) expressions, 
Marvin performs extensive checks on cluster resources, 
identifying potential issues, misconfigurations, and vulnerabilities that could pose a risk to the system. 
It helps ensure that your Kubernetes clusters are always in compliance with best practices and industry standards.

Marvin is also used as a plugin in [Zora](https://zora-docs.undistro.io/latest/).

# Installation

The pre-compiled binaries are available in [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/undistro/marvin/releases) 
and can be installed manually, via script or as a `kubectl` plugin with [Krew](https://krew.sigs.k8s.io).

## Manually

1. Download the file for your system/architecture from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/undistro/marvin/releases)
2. Unpack the downloaded archive (e.g `tar -xzf marvin_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz`)
3. Make sure the binary has execution bit turned on (`chmod +x ./marvin`)
4. Move the binary somewhere in your `$PATH` (e.g `sudo mv ./marvin /usr/local/bin/`)

## Install via script

The process above can be automated by the following script:

```shell
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/undistro/marvin/main/install.sh | sh -s -- -b $HOME/.local/bin
```

## Install via [Krew](https://krew.sigs.k8s.io)

You can install Marvin as a `kubectl` plugin via [Krew](https://krew.sigs.k8s.io):
```shell
kubectl krew install marvin
```

Then you can use Marvin with `kubectl` prefix:
```shell
kubectl marvin version
```

## Install from source

```shell
go install github.com/undistro/marvin@latest
```

# Usage

## Built-in checks

Scan the current-context Kubernetes cluster performing the [built-in checks](internal/builtins):
```shell
marvin scan
```
```

```

The default output format is `table` which represents a summary of checks result. 
You can provide `json` or `yaml` in the `-o/--output` flag to get more details.

Run `marvin scan --help` to see all available options.

## Custom checks

Marvin allows you to write your own checks by using [CEL expressions](https://github.com/google/cel-spec) in a YAML file like the example below.

```yaml
id: CUSTOM-001
severity: Medium
message: "Replicas limit"
match:
  resources:
    - group: apps
      version: v1
      resource: deployments
validations:
  - expression: >
      object.spec.replicas <= 5
    message: "Deployment with more than 5 replicas"
```

If an expression evaluates to `false`, the check fails.

This is how built-in Marvin checks are defined as well.
You can see all the built-in checks in the [`internal/builtins` folder](internal/builtins) for examples.

Then you can provide the directory path with your custom check files in the `-f/--checks` flag:

```shell
marvin scan --disable-builtin --checks ./examples/
```
```
SEVERITY   ID           CHECK            STATUS   FAILED   PASSED   SKIPPED 
Medium     CUSTOM-001   Replicas limit   Passed   0        2        0         
```

The flag `--disable-builtin` disables the built-in Marvin checks.

If the check matches a PodSpec (`Pod`, `ReplicationController`, `ReplicaSet`, `Deployment`, `StatefulSet`, `DaemonSet`, `Job` or `CronJob`)
the `podSpec` and `allContainers` inputs are available for expressions.

The `allContainers` input is a list of all containers including `initContainers` and `ephemeralContainers`.

## Skipping resources

You can use annotations to skip certain checks for specific resources in your cluster.
By adding the `marvin.undistro.io/skip` annotation to a resource, 
you can specify a comma-separated list of check IDs to skip.

Example:
```shell
kubectl annotate deployment nginx marvin.undistro.io/skip='M-202, M-111'
```

By default, Marvin will respect the `marvin.undistro.io/skip` annotation when performing checks. 
However, you can disable this behavior by using the `--disable-annotation-skip` flag.
This flag will cause Marvin to perform all checks on all resources.

If you prefer to use a different annotation to skip checks, 
you can use the `--skip-annotation` flag to specify the annotation name. 
Example: `--skip-annotation='my-company.com/skip-checks'`
